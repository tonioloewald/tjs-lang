The Origins of Coffee

Legend has it that coffee was discovered by an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi around 850 AD. He noticed his goats became unusually energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Curious, he tried the berries himself and experienced a similar stimulating effect.

The practice of roasting coffee beans and brewing them as a beverage developed in Yemen during the 15th century. Sufi monks used coffee to stay awake during nighttime devotions, and the drink spread through the Islamic world via trade routes. Coffee houses, called qahveh khaneh, became important social centers in cities like Constantinople, Cairo, and Damascus.

Coffee arrived in Europe in the 17th century, initially meeting resistance from some who called it the "bitter invention of Satan." Pope Clement VIII reportedly settled the matter by tasting the beverage and giving it papal approval. Coffee houses soon proliferated across Europe, becoming hubs for intellectual discussion and business dealings.

Today, coffee is the world's second most traded commodity after oil. Over 2.25 billion cups are consumed daily, supporting the livelihoods of approximately 125 million people worldwide. The specialty coffee movement has transformed the industry, with consumers increasingly interested in origin, processing methods, and sustainable farming practices.
